# Usage

This application allows a user to generate a resume in PDF format based on prompts and stored user inputs using the command-line.

A project manager or developer lead can use the application to generate team profiles quickly for documentation that will go to stakeholders or department heads without having to navigate to external profiles provided by each team member. The user will also be able to choose a color that matches a project theme or company/department branding palette for additional tailoring.

The generated template will include:
- public repository name
- followers
- GitHub stars
- GitHub follow count
